# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Objectives

The following vignette aims at documenting and illustrating workflows for producing PK ratio plots using the `tlf`-Library.

## 1.2. Prerequisite

This vignette focuses PK ratio plots examples. Detailed documentation on typical `tlf` workflow, use of `AgregationSummary`, `DataMapping`, `PlotConfiguration` and `Theme` can be found in `vignette("tlf-workflow")`.

# 2. Illustration of basic PK ratio plots

## 2.1. Data

The data showed in the sequel is available at the following path: `system.file("extdata", "test-data.csv", package = "tlf")`.
In the code below, the data is loaded and will be named `pkRatioData`.

```{r load-data, results='asis'}
# Load example
pkRatioData <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "test-data.csv", package = "tlf"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# pkRatioData
knitr::kable(utils::head(pkRatioData), digits = 2)
```

A list of information about `pkRatioData` can be provided through `metaData`.

```{r load-metadata, echo=FALSE}
# Load example
pkRatioMetaData <- list(Age = list(dimension = "Age",
                                   unit = "yrs"),
                        Obs = list(dimension = "Clearance",
                                   unit = "dL/h/kg"),
                        Pred = list(dimension = "Clearance",
                                    unit = "dL/h/kg"),
                        Ratio = list(dimension = "Ratio",
                                     unit = "")
                        )
```

```{r show-metadata, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(data.frame(Variable = c("Age", "Obs", "Pred", "Ratio"),
                        Dimension = c("Age", "Clearance", "Clearance", "Ratio"),
                        Unit = c("yrs", "dL/h/kg", "dL/h/kg", "")))
```

## User interface: *runPKRatioPlot()*

A user interface is available using the function `runPKRatioPlot()` and provides an easy way to understand and tune the feature of PK Ratio plots.

```{r embedded-app, echo=FALSE}
#runPKRatioPlot()
# or knitr::include_app()
```

## 2.2. `plotPKRatio`

The function plotting PK ratios is: `plotPKRatio()`. 
Basic documentation of the function can be found using: `?plotPKRatio`.
The typical usage of this function is: `plotPKRatio(data, metaData = NULL, dataMapping = NULL, plotConfiguration = NULL)`.
The output of the function is a `ggplot` object.
It can be seen from this usage that only `data` is a necessary input.
Default set ups are used for `metaData`, `dataMapping` and `plotConfiguration` within the call of `plotPKRatio`.
For instance, if `dataMapping` is not provided, a smart mapping will be tested checking if data contains a `"x"` and a `"y"` named column.
If the `data` has only two columns not named `"x"` and `"y"`, it will assume the first one should be plot in x-axis and the second in y-axis.
Then, `PKRatioPlotConfiguration` is initialized if not provided, defining a standard configuration with `PK Ratio Plot` as title, the current date as subtitle and using predifned fonts as defined by the current theme.

## 2.3. Minimal example

The minimal example can work using directly the function `plotPKRatio(data = pkRatioData[, c("Age", "Ratio")])`.

```{r minimal-example, fig.height=5, fig.width=7.5}
plotPKRatio(data = pkRatioData[,c("Age", "Ratio")])
```

## 2.4. Examples with `dataMapping`

For PK ratio, the `dataMapping` class `PKRatioDataMapping` includes 4 fields: `x`, `y`, `groupMapping` and `lines`.
`x` and `y` define which variables from the data will be plotted in X- and Y-axes, `groupMapping` is a class mapping which aesthtic property will split which variables, and `lines` defines horizontal lines performed in PK ratio plots.

### 2.4.1 `groupMapping`

Some variables can be used to cluster the data.
To this end, *PKRatioDataMapping* objects include *GroupMapping* objects that can define how to cluster based on a variable or a data.frame.
As illustrated below, most of the time, the direct input of `color` and `shape` is faster to define such objects.
Consequently, the following examples are identical:

```{r group-mapping}
# Two-step process
colorMapping <- GroupMapping$new(color = "Sex")
dataMappingA <- PKRatioDataMapping$new(x = "Age",
                                       y = "Ratio", 
                                       groupMapping = colorMapping)

print(dataMappingA$groupMapping$color$label)

# One-step process
dataMappingB <- PKRatioDataMapping$new(x = "Age", 
                                       y = "Ratio", 
                                       color = "Sex")

print(dataMappingB$groupMapping$color$label)

```

Then, in this example, `plotPKRatio` can use the groupMapping to split the data by "Gender" and associate different colors to each "Gender":

```{r dataMappingB, fig.height=5, fig.width=7.5}
plotPKRatio(data = pkRatioData, 
            dataMapping = dataMappingB)
```

Multiple groupMappings can be performed for PK ratio: data can be regrouped by `color`, `shape` and/or `size`.
The next example uses 2 groups in the groupMapping:
One group splits "Gender" by `color`, the other splits `shape` by "Amount" and "Compound".

```{r dataMapping2groups, fig.height=5, fig.width=7.5}
dataMapping2groups <- PKRatioDataMapping$new(x = "Age",
                                             y = "Ratio",
                                             color = "Sex",
                                             shape = c("Country", "AgeBin"))
plotPKRatio(data = pkRatioData, 
            dataMapping = dataMapping2groups)
```

The last examples uses another feature available in the `groupMapping` class. The class can be initilized using a `data.frame` where the last column of the data.frame will be used to split the data. In the following example, the data.frame is the following:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
groupDataFrame <- data.frame(AgeBin = c("Peds", "Adults", "Peds", "Adults", "Peds", "Adults", "Peds", "Adults"), 
                             Country = c("Canada", "Canada", "Germany", "Germany", "Canada", "Canada", "Germany", "Germany"),
                             Sex = c("Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female", "Female"),
                             Group = c("Young Canadian Males", "Old Canadian Males",
                                       "Young German Males", "Old German Males",
                                       "Young Canadian Females", "Old Canadian Females",
                                       "Young German Females", "Old German Females"))
knitr::kable(groupDataFrame)
```

The `dataMapping` introduced below will split the `color` and `shape` using the data frame.

```{r dataMappingDF, fig.height=5, fig.width=7.5}
dataMappingDF <- PKRatioDataMapping$new(x = "Age",
                                        y = "Ratio",
                                        color = groupDataFrame,
                                        shape = groupDataFrame)
plotPKRatio(data = pkRatioData, 
            dataMapping = dataMappingDF)
```


### 2.4.2  PK values defined in `lines`

In PK ratio examples, usually horizontal lines are added allowing to flag values in and out of the [0.67-1.5] as well as [0.5-2.0] ranges.
The value mapping these horizontal lines was predifined as a list: "pkRatioLine1" is 1, "pkRatioLine2" is c(0.67, 1.5) and "pkRatioLine3" is c(0.5, 2).
Consequently, for any default `PKRatioDataMapping`, you have:

```{r linesMapping}
linesMapping <- PKRatioDataMapping$new()
linesMapping$lines
```

Overwriting these value is possible by updating the value either when initializing the mapping or afterwards.
For instance:

```{r linesMapping-plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7.5}
linesMapping <- PKRatioDataMapping$new(lines = list(pkRatio1 = 1, pkRatio2 = c(0.2, 5)),
                                       x = "Age", 
                                       y = "Ratio",
                                       color = "Sex")
plotPKRatio(data = pkRatioData, 
            dataMapping = linesMapping)

```

## 2.5. Qualification of PK Ratios

The qualification of the PK Ratios can be performed using `getPKRatioMeasure`.
This function return a `data.frame` with the PK ratios within specific ranges.
As a default, these ranges are within 1.5 and 2 folds. However, they can be updated using the option `ratioLimits =` when running the function.

```{r, results='asis'}
# Test of getPKRatioMeasure
PKRatioMeasure <- getPKRatioMeasure(data = pkRatioData[,c("Age", "Ratio")])

knitr::kable(x = PKRatioMeasure,
             caption = "Qualification of PK Ratios")
```


## 2.6. Plot Configuration

To configure the plot properties, `PKRatioPlotConfiguration` objects can be used.
They combine multiple features that set the plot properties.
PK ratio plos consists in *lines* and *points*.
As illustrated in the vignette related to *PlotConfiguration* objects and *Theme*, you can tune the aesthetic maps and their selections.
Colors, shapes and size of the PK ratio scatter points can be tuned in the plotConfiguration *points* field.
Likewise, colors, linetype and size of the PK ratio lines can be tuned in the plotConfiguration *lines* field.
